# Maperial : a new way to create maps

Maperial is a free javascript API to create *dynamical* maps for your web
applications.

Configure your own set of layers and parameters to visualize, analyze, and understand your data.

For now we stick on enhancing this API and hope to see a community
gathering around, which would mean we are on the right path to provide a new
map tool.

Enjoy drafting and sharing your maps, and don't forget
to let us know your feedback !
